Dance Floor Choose Your Own Adventure


About:

The dance floor is in your hands! Enjoy going through multiple cases of the dance floor controlling how your adventure ends. You enter in inputs of what you want your character to do, from punching the DJ to eating dinner. 


Libraries: 

I used Java.util.Scanner to get the inputs of the person, and the rest being base java. 


How To Use:

The game prints to the Console, and you type in the choice number, for instance, if it is:
    1. Dance
    2. Leave
You would write "1" to dance and "2" to leave, without the quotation marks.
